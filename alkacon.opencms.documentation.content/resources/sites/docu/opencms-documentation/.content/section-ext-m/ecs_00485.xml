        <content><![CDATA[<p>When you call the OpenCms shell in stand-alone mode, a new instance of OpenCms is started. You do not need to have OpenCms already running in your Tomcat (or other servlet container). You do not even need to start the servlet container at all.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info alert-danger">You should be aware that the shell starts a new OpenCms instance when executed in stand-alone mode. That may interfere with an already running instance started by Tomcat. So we strongly recommend not using the shell while OpenCms is already running.</div>
<p>When running the shell via RMI, you are connected to your OpenCms instance running in the serlvet-container (e.g. Tomcat).</p>
<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Connect via RMI always when your OpenCms is normally running in the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).</strong></div>]]></content>
