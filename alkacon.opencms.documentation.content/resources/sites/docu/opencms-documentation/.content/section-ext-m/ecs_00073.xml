        <content><![CDATA[<p>When you import or export modules there are some common pitfalls that you should be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Importing modules from the wrong site</em>: Typically modules are imported and exported from the root site. In some rare cases, modules can also be im- or exported from another site, e.g., <code>/sites/default/</code>. Since the folder structure in the module's zip file that is build on export is relative to the site you exported the module from, modules exported from the root site should always be imported in the root site again. Also modules exported from other sites, e.g., <code>/sites/default/</code> should be added in another site again. This is in particular of interest, when the module&nbsp; contains resources that are not in the <code>/system/</code> or <code>/shared/</code> folder - otherwise the site is not that interesting because folders <code>/system/</code> and<code> /shared/</code> are always assumed relative to the root site.</li>
<li><em>Modules with overlapping resources</em>: If module resources are specified via folders, all resources in the folder belong to the module. Thus, if module <code>A</code> has specified all resources in folder <code>a/</code> as module resources and then a module <code>B</code> is added, with resources in folder <code>a/b/</code>, the folder <code>a/b/</code> will also belong to the resources of module <code>a/</code>. Thus, deleting module <code>a/</code> will also delete folder <code>a/b/</code> and an export of module <code>A</code> will also contain folder <code>a/b/</code>. Hence there are usually unwanted interaction between the modules when overlapping resources exist.</li>
<li><em>Forgetting to publish before export</em>: Only published versions of resources are exported when a module is exported. So, if you export a module unpublished changes will not be contained.</li>
