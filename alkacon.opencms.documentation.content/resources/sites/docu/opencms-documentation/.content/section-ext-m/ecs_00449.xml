        <content><![CDATA[<p><em>Do not use a shared server.</em> OpenCms is Java-based and you need to run a JVM on the server. Furthermore, OpenCms will keep a lot of information in the memory of the server, if you want to run a well performing website. Therefore, we do not recommend using a shared server - OpenCms will constantly allocate system resources.</p>
<p><em>Memory is the most important performance factor.</em> Memory is much more influential than CPU speed. It is recommended to have at least 2GB of memory available.</p>
<p>In many scenarios it will suffice if all elements of an OpenCms installation (OpenCms itself in the servlet containter, the DBMS, optionally an additional webserver) reside on one computer, or are splitted over several servers. <em>Sites expecting heavy traffic will probably need a clustered configuration where the load is distributed across more than one OpenCms instance.</em> For a clustered installation use the <a href="%(link0)">Alkacon OCEE Cluster Manager</a>.</p>]]></content>
