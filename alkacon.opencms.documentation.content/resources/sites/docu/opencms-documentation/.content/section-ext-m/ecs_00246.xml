        <content><![CDATA[<p>To edit (XML) contents, OpenCms features two possiblities: the form-based content editor and the inline content editor. Both are closely related and internally just two modes of the same editor. Nevertheless, each has its advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>While the inline editor allows you to stay on your webpage, the form-based editor opens as a new page - which is a plus of the inline editor.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the form-based editor provides a complete view of all the content and also allows comfortable editing of non-textual values - here the inline editor has only limited capabilities.</li>
<li>Moreover, inline editing only works only for the current language. In the form-based editor all languages can be edited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the topics listed below to get a more detailed impression of the editors.</p>]]></content>
