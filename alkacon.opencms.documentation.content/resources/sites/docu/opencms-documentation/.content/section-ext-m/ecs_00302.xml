        <content><![CDATA[<p>By right-clicking on a resource in the "current folder's content"-view, you get a context menu, exposing all functions available to change or explore the data of the resource. Depending on the VFS version you're working in, the options are different. Online you have much fewer options than offline since you can't change any resource online. Options also differ for different resource types. For example, you can edit XML content via the content editor, but for a text file you can edit only the source code and for folders there is no content to edit at all.</p>
<p>Below, we give you an overview of (most of) the menu options, grouped by different kinds of options and highlight at which resources these options can be performed. We assume you have administrator rights. Otherwise some options may not be available.</p>]]></content>
