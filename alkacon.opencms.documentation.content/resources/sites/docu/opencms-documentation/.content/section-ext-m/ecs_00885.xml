        <content><![CDATA[<p>When you install OpenCms locally and you want to access it (in the default JLan configuration) via <code>\\localhost\OPENCMS</code> (Windows) or <code>smb://localhost/OPENCMS</code> (Linux, MacOS), you typically only have to rename the config file<code> jLanConfig.xml.windows</code> or <code>jLanConfig.xml.linux</code> to <code>jLanConfig.xml</code>. But you typically will encounter some additional problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>On Windows 7</em>: The port 445 used to provide the share is already blocked by a service named "server". Go to "Control Panel" -&gt; "Administrative Tools" -&gt; "Services". Stop the service "server" and change (therefore right-click the service and choose "Properties" from the context menu) the "Starttype" to "disabled". Then restart Windows. Afterwards you should be able to connect to <code>\\localhost\OPENCMS</code> (using a valid OpenCms account, e.g., the user "Admin" with password "admin" in a default installation.</li>
<li><em>On Linux</em>: You may need to map the port 1445, at which the share is exposed back to port 445. You may use a tool like "socat" for that task and mount the VFS similar as done in the script below (that should be run as root)</li>
