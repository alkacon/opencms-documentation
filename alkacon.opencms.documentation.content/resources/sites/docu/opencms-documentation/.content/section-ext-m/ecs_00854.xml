        <content><![CDATA[<p>The OpenCms VFS and hence all files located therein can be accessed via the workplace's explorer.</p>
<p>The explorer has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>it allows the use of all "special" features of the VFS</li>
<li>editing XML files opens the content editor</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some inconveniences, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to leave your usual work environment.</li>
<li>You are tied to the source code editor shipped with OpenCms.</li>
<li>You cannot keep several files open for editing, copying and comparing them.</li>
<li>You have to change sites when changing files in the root site and viewing changes in web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>To overcome these limitations, OpenCms allows you to mount the virtual file system to the local file system of your computer. There are three ways available to mount the VFSâ€“WebDAV, CMIS, and Network share access. WebDAV is the currently recommended way.</p>]]></content>
