If you are in the online project, collection is performed for the online resources, if you are offline, the offline resources are collected.</p>
<p>From the collected resources all are matched by interpreting them as plain text. In particular, for XML contents, you can also match the XML-nodes, because the XML file is interpreted as plain text.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>Similarly to the "Elements in page" mode, all container pages the provided content is placed on are collected. Now you can rename nested containers made up by the elements. This can be interesting if your formatter for the element has changed and now the nested container has a different name. Unless you rename the container in all exsisting container pages, the contents in that containers will not display anymore.</p>]]></content>

If you are in the online project, only online indexes can be used for collection (e.g. Solr Online), if you are offline, only offline indexes (e.g., Solr Offline) can be used for collection. You can specify a Solr query directly. Also the information you provided in "Search folder" and "Resource type" will be merged in your Solr query.</p>
