        <content><![CDATA[<p>OpenCms stores all resources in a database. The entries make up a virtual file system (VFS). It can be considered as a real file system, i.e., a folder structure with files in different folders. But it provides some more features. All resources in the VFS, folders and files, carry extra information. Moreover, there exist two versions off the VFS: "Offline" and "Online" and even the history of files is stored. To understand OpenCms, it is <em>not</em> necessary to fully understand all details of the VFS and the database structure, but some points are useful to know for understanding how OpenCms works.</p>]]></content>
