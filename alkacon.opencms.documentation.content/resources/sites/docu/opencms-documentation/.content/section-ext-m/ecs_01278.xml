        <content><![CDATA[<p>Every good getting started guide should start with some bad news: unfortunately, learning template development in OpenCms is not as easy as learning a web language or a web framework.</p>
<p>When learning HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, all you need is a browser, a text editor, and the joy of learning a new language. Learning one of the many fancy web frameworks out there is not much different. You start with an empty project, have your hello world project up and running after some minutes, and then start writing code that is already relevant for real projects.</p>
<p>It would be great if the same learning curve would be possible with OpenCms too. Unfortunately, the approach to start from scratch with a hello world template and after some hours having a nice looking website available that can be authored by content editors, does not work with OpenCms. To build a website template from scratch needs an understanding of many concepts integrated into OpenCms as well as their interaction and configuration.</p>
<p>But what you get at the end of this guide is of course more than a simple tool written with a fancy web framework. You have a fully interactive website template running in a content management system that offers a highly user-friendly authoring environment for content editors. Your template is part of a website system that can host the whole web presence of larger (international) organizations, where your template can be customized for the needs of individual organizational websites. Websites using your template can be maintained by whole content editor and administration teams with different responsibilities and different levels of technical expertise.</p>
<p>What is not so easy is the "to start from scratch". For this reason, this guide is accompanied by an examples module that contains all the necessary configurations around the actual template. In this way you can concentrate on single aspects of template development such as <a href="%(link0)">writing formatters</a> or defining a content type without having to know the big picture.</p>
<p>There is a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file available on GitHub with which you should get OpenCms and the examples module up and running locally within minutes. After installation is completed, you can just login to the OpenCms workplace and start exploring and modifying the examples.</p>]]></content>
