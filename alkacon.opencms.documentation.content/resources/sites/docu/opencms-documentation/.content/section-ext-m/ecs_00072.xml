        <content><![CDATA[<p>If you export the module, the configuration is looked up and all the resources from the VFS that are in a folder specified under the <code>&lt;resources&gt;</code> node are exported, i.e., written to the RFS. The folder structure is kept and the exported resources are zipped. Additionally a <code>manifest.xml</code> file is created and added in the zip at the root folder. This <code>manifest.xml</code> records all the information on the module from the <code>opencms-modules.xml</code> and additionally all the meta-data from the exported resources, e.g., the properties, modification dates, etc. that are attached to files or folders.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">Exporting a module means to export the online version of the module resources. So never forget to publish changes before you export a module.</div>
<p>Importing a module to the system means to take the module's zip file that was generated by the export and extract it into the VFS. Using the information from the <code>manifest.xml</code> the meta information (e.g., properties) are set at the resources and a configuration entry for the module is added to the <code>opencms-modules.xml</code>. Note that, when you import a module that is already present in the system, the currently installed module is first deleted and then the new version is imported. If you import an older version of a module, the newer version is also replaced. So, there is no difference in up- or downgrading.</p>
<p>The import procedure also checks if all specified module dependencies are met.</p>
<p>Exporting a module is different than deleting it. Export does not remove the module from the system, it just builds the zip file (created in <code>{webapp home}/WEB-INF/packages/modules/</code>). Deleting a module will remove all resources specified in the <code>&lt;resources&gt;</code> node in <code>opencms-modules.xml</code> and also remove the configuration of that module in that config file. Furthermore, before deleting a module, dependencies are checked. Thus, only modules where no other modules depend on can be deleted.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">Be aware that deleting a module can not be undone.</div>]]></content>
