        <content><![CDATA[<p>Since OpenCms 10 two export formats for modules are present: a reduced and a verbose one. The difference is the data that is stored in the <code>manifest.xml</code> in the exported module zip file. <em>We recommend using the reduced export format</em> as long as you do not have a serious reason for exporting more information. The reduced format is in particular recommended if you track your changes in a version control system. The format omits lots of meta information. This information, e.g., who has when created or edited a resource, is typically unnecessary since your version control system will take record of these information anyway. Moreover, keeping the extra information also in the manifest file likely causes merge conflicts.</p>
<p>To set the export format, go to the module management, select your module and edit it. As shown below, you have to check the setting "Use reduced export format"</p>]]></content>
