        <content><![CDATA[<p>In OpenCms you can define groups and add users to groups. Furthermore, each user has roles in OpenCms. <em>Both, groups and roles are used to set the permissions of a user.</em> But, the permissions of groups and roles are given with different focus:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Groups are used to control access to resources in the VFS.</em></li>
<li><em>Roles are used to control access to the system's functions according to the requirements of the respective role, e.g., control over whether the workplace can be accessed, whether resources can be published, whether user accounts can be managed, ...<br /></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The different focus of groups and roles also implies differences in their handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles are fixed while groups can be created or deleted</li>
<li>Group permissions can be set on all resources, role permissions are typically not added to resources, except in some <code>/system/</code> folders.</li>
<li>Roles may override permissions set on groups or users, e.g., for the root administrator all permission settings are ignored, he always has all permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when you think of designing your permission system in OpenCms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at what a user should be able to do and assign their role according to those tasks. An overview of the available roles is found <a href="%(link0)">here</a>.</li>
<li>Think about which users should have access to which resources and use groups to allow or deny access.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
