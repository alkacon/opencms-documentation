        <content><![CDATA[<p>In OpenCms you can build multilingual websites easily. Starting with an unilingual website, the tutorial tells you how to add localizations.</p>
<p>There are two ways to add localizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The multi-tree approach</strong>: That means, each translation of the website has it's own folder tree. This way localizations of the site can diverge in content and structure.</li>
<li><strong>The single-tree approach</strong>: That means, we keep the single folder tree of the unilingual site and make it accessible in various locales.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial covers both approaches. You can decide which approach you choose. Both have their pros and cons that are briefly discussed as well.</p>]]></content>
