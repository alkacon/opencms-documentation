<p>Include CSS file and other static resources in the head section of your template JSP by means of a <code>&lt;cms:link&gt;</code> tag and the <code>%(link.weak:)</code> macro as shwon in the example below. The macro has the advantage that—if you once rename or move a static resource file—OpenCms will automatically adjust the link in the template JSP.</p>
<p>The example below renders a nicely styled notification using some class names from the included CSS.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>Since a template is getting larger and larger over time, it is good practice to split the template JSP into several parts. For example, the header section and the footer section of a website may themselves be quite extensive JSP code blocks. Store such code blocks into their own <code>header.jsp</code> and <code>footer.jsp</code> files and include the JSPs by means of a <code>&lt;cms:include&gt;</code> tag and the <code>%(link.weak:)</code> macro. By convention, the right place for included JSP files is in the <code>elements/</code> folder of a module, e.g., <code>/system/modules/org.opencms.examples/elements/</code>.</p>
<p>Note that all parts of a webpage that are defined in the template JSP or in outsourced JSP files cannot be edited by a content editor. If you want the content editor being able to change information in the header section or the footer section, use a <code>&lt;cms:container&gt;</code> instead as explained below.</p>]]></content>
