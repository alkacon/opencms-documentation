        <content><![CDATA[<p>Via preferences, users can configure OpenCms according to their needs. For example, workplace language, project, site and folder displayed on login can be configured. But also various other settings are available. Since OpenCms 9.5, the context menu of page and sitemap editor provide access to a dialog for changing the preferences.</p>
<p>The preferences available can be configured for each OpenCms installation separately. This allows for example to add one's own user preferences. Here we explain how to configure user preferences and how to access them in a JSP. We explain differences between user preferences and the additional information that can be attached to a user account.</p>]]></content>
