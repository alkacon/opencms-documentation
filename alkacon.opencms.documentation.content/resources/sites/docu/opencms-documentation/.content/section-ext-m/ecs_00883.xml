        <content><![CDATA[<p>The OpenCms network share access uses the JLAN Enterprise authenticator, which should work with both NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 authentication. Users can use their normal OpenCms accounts to log in to the network shares. Please note that users need to have logged in at least once normally to the OpenCms workplace before they can log in to a network share, since the network share code uses a different password hash type, and the password hash for network share access is only saved when the user logs in to the workplace.</p>
<p>The user will not be able to connect to a share if they do not have “View” permissions for the root folder configured for that share, even if their user name and password are correct. Users will also not be able to see files for which they lack “View” permissions over a network share connection.</p>]]></content>
