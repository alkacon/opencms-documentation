        <content><![CDATA[<p>The export user is used internally by OpenCms for static export (of JSP-output for example). This user is in the Guests group and does not have to log in. If you want to get files statically exported, the user needs read permissions on the files. By the separation of Export user and Guest user you can block access to files for visitors of your website that are not logged in, but still have files exported. This may for example be useful in an intranet.</p>]]></content>
