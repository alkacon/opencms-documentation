        <content><![CDATA[<p>Creating a website is a challenging task. Before you have a site where content can be added and is rendered nicely, various steps have to be performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more templates defining the layout of the webpages have to be created.</li>
<li>The basic structure of the website has to be set up.</li>
<li>Mechanisms determining which content is shown and which pages can be added have to be set up.</li>
</ul>
<p>In various topics we describe how to create a website and configure it. It is assumed that you already have an HTML prototype of your website and you just want to realize your site in OpenCms. What we exclude here is how to create content (types).</p>]]></content>
