        <content><![CDATA[<p>A particularly powerful chaining technique is <strong>variation by chaining</strong>, which depends on the concept of <strong>formatter keys</strong> introduced in OpenCms 12.</p>
<p>Formatter keys are a replacement for the former formatter IDs and are activated by default since OpenCms 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea behind is the following:</p>
<p>There might be projects where a lot of contents already exist in sites and the <strong>requirements in respect to HTML Markup rendering are changing over time or diverge completely between sites</strong>. In this case it would be inefficient to introduce a new formatter and go through all pages of all sites to re-configure all existing contents using the new formatter.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">With <strong>formatter keys</strong> it is possible to introduce alternative HTML markup rendering for existing contents per site without content re-configuring.</div>]]></content>
