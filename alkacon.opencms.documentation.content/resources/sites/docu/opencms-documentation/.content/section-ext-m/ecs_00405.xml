        <content><![CDATA[<p>OpenCms supports designing websites for multiple devices, e.g., a desktop computer, a tablet or a mobile phone. In particular, OpenCms let's you change formatters and templates dependent on the device your website is shown on. It also allows to deliver content elements only for some devices and to preview a webpage directly as it appears on various devices.
