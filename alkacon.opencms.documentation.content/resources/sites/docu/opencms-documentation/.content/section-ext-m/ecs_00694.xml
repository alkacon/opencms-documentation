        <content><![CDATA[<p>We suggest to use the integrated list type for searches, or - if this is not enough - the &lt;cms:search&gt; tag for full-text searches. Partly for the first suggestion and necessarily for the second one, you should know how a Solr query is constructed in general.</p>
<p>The best way to play with Solr on your OpenCms instance is the Solr handler. Here you can type plain Solr queries and get responses immediately.</p>
<p>We explain a search with a concrete example (that you may vary a bit depending on your OpenCms installation):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show articles in the default site that have been changed in the last 24 hours and sort them by the (english) title ascending.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Below, we show different solutions to perform that search.</p>]]></content>
