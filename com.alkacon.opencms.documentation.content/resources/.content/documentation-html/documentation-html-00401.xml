      <content><![CDATA[<p>UGC allows you to create and manipulate content from the online project. You can map values stored in XML content into a form and update the XML content with the form's values. Communication between the content and the form is session based. For security reasons, sessions are established at the server-side. Hence, you can control who can add or edit which content via which form.</p>
<p>To connect form and content in an established session, a JavaScript API is provided. To reduce the effort in writing lengthy mappings, a jQuery based wrapper for the native API is additionally available. It allows high level mapping operations of content elements and form fields. These operations capture the most frequent use cases.</p>]]></content>
