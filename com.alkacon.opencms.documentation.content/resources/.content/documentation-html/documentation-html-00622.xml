      <content><![CDATA[<p>Element views are sorted by their display order. From the views that can be chosen, i.e., the non-empty views where the user has sufficient permissions to access them, a view with the smallest display order is chosen as default. Typically, if not empty, the default view is chosen by default.</p>
<p>If a user once selects a view, this view is kept - at least as long as it can be chosen.</p>]]></content>
