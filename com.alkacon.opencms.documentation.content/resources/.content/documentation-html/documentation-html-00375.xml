      <content><![CDATA[<p>In the traditional workplace you find a "Site"-selector in the upper menu bar. Here you can choose between different sites. By default, three sites are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root site (<code>/</code>)</li>
<li>The default site (<code>/sites/default/</code>)</li>
<li>The shared folder (<code>/shared/</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sites provide access to subtrees of the VFS.</em> The VFS has a specific structure with basically three main folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/shared/</code> where content and resources that are used by various websites hosted in the OpenCms installation are stored</li>
<li><code>/sites/</code> where each website hosted by the OpenCms installation has its own subfolder that contains the website's pages and typically the contents used on the website and some config files.</li>
<li><code>/system/</code> where all OpenCms resources are found, that are not part of a website's structure, configuration or content. These are, for example, templates, content type definitions and formatters (shipped in modules), but also resources of the workplace etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The root site exposes the whole VFS, but it is not the perfect view for all OpenCms users.</em> From the root site you can navigate to each folder in the VFS. Hence, also to each resource that may be expose by other sites. You can see, and probably edit, templates, formatters, content type defintions and all the other stuff. Administrators or template developers may work in the root site. But it is definitely not the place for content editors.</p>
<p><em>A site for a web site, such as <code>/sites/default/</code>, exposes the structure of a web site, i.e., only the folders below the web site's root folder, such as all folders below <code>/sites/default/</code>.</em> When you view a web site generated by OpenCms, its structure closely corresponds to the folder structure of the VFS that is exposed in the web site's "site". Which "web site"-sites are available and under which URLÂ  the corresponding web sites can be reached can be configured. There are advantages in regarding the VFS with the web site's root folder as root as a separate site:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you call a page on a web site build with OpenCms, the URL will not have the folders, <code>/sites/default/</code>, or similar, included. It starts at the root folder configured for this web site.</li>
<li>Depending on your role in OpenCms you should see only resources for one web site. Here the view of the web site's site is perfect. You do not have to care nor know about the stuff in the /system/ folder - or the other web sites in your OpenCms installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>That URLs are relative to the configured web site's root folder influences the view of pages when you are logged in:</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">You can only view web pages when you are working in the root site. You have to switch to the respective web site's site. Otherwise, calling a web page or editing an already opened one will not work properly.</div>
<p><em>The /shared/ folder provides a way to share content or other resources between various sites. </em>When you have more than one site in OpenCms, for example, you run an intranet and an internet web site on your installation, you may want to use the same content, e.g., an article describing your company's portfolio, in both of the sites. To have easy access to the article in both web sites, in particular if you want content managers to place the article on your web sites, it can be placed in the <code>/shared/</code> folder.</p>]]></content>
