      <content><![CDATA[<p>The virtual file system provides the usual features of a "normal" file system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files and folders can be moved, copied and deleted</li>
<li>Permissions can be set</li>
<li>Resources are locked if someone edits them</li>
<li>Resources have a creation and a "last modified" date</li>
</ul>
<p>But the VFS comes also with some extra features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources are typed (finer than just distinguishing file and folder)</li>
<li>Resources also have, potentially, user-defined properties attached</li>
<li>Resources in the system can be related (i.e., a dependency between them is established)</li>
<li>The history of resources (state when publishing a resource) can be saved and restored</li>
<li>When resources are moved, links are automatically adjusted (if the link-relationship-engine is used)</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the traditional workplace's explorer allows you to publish resources. But more on this in the next section.</p>]]></content>
