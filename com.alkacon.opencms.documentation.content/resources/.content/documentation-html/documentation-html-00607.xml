      <content><![CDATA[<p>With OpenCms you can build a website that perfectly fits your needs. The logic can be as complex as needed. Here's what facilitates building the perfect website easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>The clear concept of content makes it <strong>easy to design content</strong> types that fit exactly to your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced permission system</strong> and user management allows easy configuration of which user can access which content or webpage and who can alter things.</li>
<li>OpenCms builds webpages based on JSPs (Java Server pages) - thus <strong>arbitrary Java code can run</strong> in the background <strong>to get the logic you want</strong> into your page.</li>
<li>The OpenCms <strong>module system</strong> makes it easy to add or remove functionality from OpenCms.</li>
<li>An OpenCms instance can run on a <strong>server cluster</strong>. So you can get the performance or reliability you need for your website.</li>
