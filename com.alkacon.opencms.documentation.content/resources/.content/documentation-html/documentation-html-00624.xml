      <content><![CDATA[<p>For historical reasons, assigning a role to a user will automatically add the user to the Users group. Removing all roles from a user will cancel that user's membership of the Users group, also automatically.</p>
<p>Once you have assigned a role to a user, you can remove that user from the users group without loss of role. This should usually not be necessary, but if you do so, keep in mind that the user is added to the Users group again on change of role.</p>]]></content>
