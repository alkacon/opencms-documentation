      <content><![CDATA[<p>We describe how to work with the OpenCms shell in the interactive mode, i.e., without passing a script to the shell. But most information are also useful for writing scripts, because in batch mode, the shell starts exactly as in interactive mode - just the the commands you would type in interactive mode are all read from the given script.</p>
<p>When the shell starts it starts a new OpenCms instance and displays some information on the startup process plus help information. When startup is finished, you see a prompt where you can type commands.</p>]]></content>
