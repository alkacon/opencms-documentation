<ul>
<li><em>The context-specific help. </em>Whenever you hover over a button/link you get a hint of what the link is for. Also when you see question mark signs at input fields, hover over them to see hints in the help box.</li>
<li><em>The overview of administrative tasks </em>allows you to easily switch between tasks. This is even more important, since, during a session, the administration view will reopen in the sub-menu you left it.</li>
<li><em>The breadcrumb navigation</em> helps you to not lose the overview - in particular for tasks that have more than one submenu.</li>
