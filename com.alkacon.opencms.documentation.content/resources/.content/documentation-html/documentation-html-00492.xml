      <content><![CDATA[<p>Here is a short description for each of the parts of the host configuration (numbers correspond to the config-file parts):</p>
<ol>
<li>To use the webapp's home folder as the document root is not necessarily required. But it allows the avoidance of passing queries to Tomcat. All files statically exported by OpenCms reside in the webapp's home folder. Using it as the document root for your Apache virtual host allows Apache to access and serve these files directly without consulting Tomcat. This will increase performance</li>
<li>To allow Apache to access the webapp's home directory, appropriate rights have to be granted. Note in particular the "<code>Require all granted</code>" line - that was not necessary in old Apache versions.</li>
<li>Logging configuration is not necessary, but typically advantageous.</li>
<li>URL rewriting is essential. Enable the rewrite engine - the log configuration is optional (and different in Apache &lt; 2.4).</li>
<li>Redirecting to a secure site for accessing the workplace is not necessary, but useful to increase security. Note that the secure site that you redirect to has to be set up separately.</li>
<li>Forbidding access to php file is also an optional security setting not directly tied to OpenCms. With the given configuration, a "403 Forbidden" error is returned.</li>
<li>These rewrite rules are used to remove the second "opencms/" part in typical OpenCms URLs (e.g., from the typical URL "www.example.com/opencms/<strong>opencms/</strong>index.html"  the highlighted "opencms/<br />Note the rewrite conditions: statically exported files are accessed without the "opencms/"-prefix anyway, so they must not be rewritten. The same holds for URLs that direct to OpenCms' WEBDav interface.</li>
<li>OpenCms has a special 404-Handler that handles static export. If a file is not already exported, it is not found on the RFS and then the 404-handler is called. The file is exported and served. Thus, if a file that should be exported is not available, it is necessary to redirect to the OpenCms 404-handler.</li>
<li>Using the module proxy_ajp, Tomcat is connected like a usual reverse proxy. Note, that the ajp protocol is used for the connection and that the URLs that Apache should handle directly are not passed. <code>ProxyPreserveHost</code> is enabled, because OpenCms detects the site to serve also by host name.</li>
