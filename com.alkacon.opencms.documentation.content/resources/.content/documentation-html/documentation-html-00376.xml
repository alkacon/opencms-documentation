      <content><![CDATA[<p>Simplified, projects are just special views of the versions of the VFS. Their focus is to make groups of users "responsible" for a special set of resources. Thus, a project may exist for example, if you have to rework something on your web site. You can assign managers to a project, that can publish changes on the project resources and delete the project, if the task is fulfilled. There are also some other options. Projects have no influence on the permissions of users, they are only helpful in structuring tasks. There are two special, predefined projects: the "Offline" project, that provides access to the complete offline version of the VFS, and the "Online" project, that provides access to the complete online version of the VFS.</p>
<p><em>You can define own projects that contain resources of the offline version of the VFS, but you cannot create your own projects for the online version.</em> Setting up additional projects that provide a special view of resources in the offline version of the VFS can help you to structure tasks and to narrow down their view of the VFS according to the task. You can also publish all resources in a project in one run. For the online version of the VFS no additional projects can be defined. There is no need for it. The online version can only be viewed and you cannot alter something anyway - so no task can be performed on it.</p>
<p>What is important to know:</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">Self-defined projects are only different views of the offline version of the VFS. They do not make separate copies of their resources. Hence, if a file belongs to two projects and it is changed in one project, it has also changed in the other project.</div>]]></content>
