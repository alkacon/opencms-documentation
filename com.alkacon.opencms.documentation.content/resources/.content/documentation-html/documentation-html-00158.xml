      <content><![CDATA[<p>To make a content type defined in a module available in OpenCms it has to be configured as a resource type. The definition of the content type and its configuration as a resource type had to be done manually up to OpenCms 9.0. Since OpenCms 9.0.1 the whole process is supported by a graphical interface in the workplace.</p>
<p>Go to “Module Management”, select the module where the content type should be added and click on the module name to get to the detail view of the module. Now, choose the option “Add resource type”.</p>]]></content>
