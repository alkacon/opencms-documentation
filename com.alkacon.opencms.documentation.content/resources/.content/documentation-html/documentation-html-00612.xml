      <content><![CDATA[<p>OpenCms is suitable for building highly complex multi-lingual websites, editable by manifold users with different permissions. You will profit particularly if your website's content has to be easily editable by users with no technical background knowledge, possibly in multiple languages. Thus OpenCms plays to its strength in<strong> internet or intranet sites of (large international) companies or organizations</strong>, where various employees edit content.</p>
<p>For your <strong>private website</strong>, OpenCms may be the choice as well. You need to put some effort into designing your own content types and setting up your own layout - or just use and adjust the demo template. But, there are other CMSs that will come with more predefined templates and add-ons that you typically want on a private website. Furthermore, for running OpenCms you need to install the JDK on your webserver and run a JVM. This will exclude most cheap options for hosting your private site.</p>]]></content>
