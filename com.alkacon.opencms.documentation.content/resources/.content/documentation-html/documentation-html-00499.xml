      <content><![CDATA[<p>Configuring a secure virtual host is nearly identical to the configuration of a non-secure one. The differences are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The port has to be changed to 443.</li>
<li>The SSL engine has to be configured.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast to the configuration of the non-secure site above, of course you should not redirect to a secure site again (part 5).</p>
<p>Below, we provide the configuration of a secure site, in particular of the site where the non-secure site configured above redirects to for workplace access. It nearly mirrors the config file from the unsecured site. Only two spots are important:</p>
<ol>
<li>The port in the <code>VirtualHost</code> node has changed to the SSL port <code>443</code>.</li>
<li>Part 5 is replaced. Formerly, we redirected to the secured site. Now we set up the SSL engine.</li>
</ol>]]></content>
