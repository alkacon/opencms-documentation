        <content><![CDATA[<p>Content types defined in XSDs are made available as resource types (and explorer types) with a unique name and ID in the opencms-modules.xml (the file is located in the RFS in the folder <code>WEB-INF/config/</code>). The unique names are used for example in module and sitemap configurations. While new IDs for cloned types are chosen automatically, the unique names are adjusted via prefix substitution. If present, the given “Source prefix name” is removed from the original name of the resource type and afterwards the “Target prefix name” is prepended.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>Before OpenCms 9, formatters were configured in XSDs. If the formatters are part of the cloned module, or if a module containing the original formatters has been cloned in advance, the URI to the formatters stored in the XSDs has to be adjusted. In particular, the module name in the path has to be updated. This is achieved by setting the “Formatter source” to the name of the module that contained the original formatters, and the “Formatter target” to the name of the module where the cloned formatters are located.</p>
<p>Note that formatter configs are not adjusted.</p>]]></content>
