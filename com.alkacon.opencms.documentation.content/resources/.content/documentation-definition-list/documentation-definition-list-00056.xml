        <content><![CDATA[<p>One variation entry of this resource is generated for every different user. Please keep in mind that this might lead to a great number of entries in the cache in case you have a website with many different users. You should know that any client not authorized is treated in OpenCms as user "Guest", so all requests always belong to a specific user.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>One variation entry of this resource is generated for every "top level" URI that is requested. This is useful for navigation elements that are included as a sub-element on a page, where usually the URI of the requested page decides which entries have to be displayed in the navigation.</p>]]></content>

      <Description name="Description0">
        <links/>
        <content><![CDATA[<p>This directive sets a timeout at which a cached resource will be invalidated. The given integer represents a <em>minute - interval</em> which starts at 0.00h of the day the cache key gets calculated. A value of 60 would indicate that this entry will reach its timeout at the beginning of every full hour. A timeout of 20 indicates that the entry is invalidated at x.00, x.20 and x.40 of every hour etc. A "timed out" resource will stay in the cache but will be re-calculated the next time it gets requested.</p>]]></content>

      <Term><![CDATA[params or params=(param1, param2, ...)]]></Term>
      <Description name="Description0">
        <links/>
        <content><![CDATA[<p>If you use <code>params=(param1, param2,...)</code> there will be one variation entry generated for every value of all listed parameters (or combination thereof). If you use <code>params</code> there will be one variation entry of this resource generated for every different parameter value of every different parameter. This directive is useful if you have something like a "show article" page that gets dynamically calculated from a database with something like an "id" parameter that selects the article to be displayed. So if you have a page <code>showarticle.jsp</code> that gets usually called like <code>showarticle.jsp?article_id=123</code>, you could just set the caching properties of this page to <code>params=(article_id)</code> and thus cache every single article page.</p>]]></content>

      <Term><![CDATA[no-params or no-params=(no-param1, no-param2)]]></Term>
      <Description name="Description0">
        <links/>
        <content><![CDATA[<p>This directive <em>prevents</em> the caching of a resource. If you use <code>no-params</code> the occurrence of any parameter in the request will prevent caching of the resource. If you use <code>no-params=(no-param1, no-param2,...)</code>, the occurrence of any of the listed parameters will prevent caching of the resource. This directive is useful on simple forms. Usually (esp. using JSPs) you will have only one URI for all requests to the form, i.e., the form is posted to its own URL and the JSP behind it handles the form validation. With the <code>no-params</code> directive you can cache the "first", empty view of the form, while any requests with data in the form will cause the page to be generated dynamically. Note that these "blocking" directives always overrule all other directives.</p>]]></content>

        <content><![CDATA[<p>This cache directives creates one variation of a page for every (or every listed) element. This important directive is required if multiple xmlpage elements are included from the same URI.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you are using the session cache directive in combination with the user directive, your browser might not be able to distinguish between the different versions delivered by OpenCms because of its own internal browser caching. In such an scenario, you must disable the browser caching by setting correct http headers in your OpenCms application.</div>]]></content>
