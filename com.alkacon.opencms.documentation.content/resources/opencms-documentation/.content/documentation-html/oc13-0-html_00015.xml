      <content><![CDATA[<p>Formatter keys in Mercury, e.g. <code>m/layout/group</code>, follow a convention in taking up the path where formatters are stored in the module. Although the path-like structure of Mercury's formatter keys is just a convention, it is common practice that a formatter key bears some sort of semantics.</p>
<p>Semantics are a helpful tool to keep the overview but lead to problems if the name of a formatter key changes over time. Especially if the formatter key is already used by many contents in many sites.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Alias formatter keys are a convenience method if the variation by chaining technique is used frequently and if the names of formatter keys change over time.</strong></div>
<p>Alias formatter keys provide <strong>two utilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>contents that configure an old deprecated formatter key, can be rendered with a formatter identified by a new formatter key</li>
<li>if contents referencing an old formatter key are saved, the old formatter key is automatically replaced (and saved) by the new one</li>
</ul>]]></content>
