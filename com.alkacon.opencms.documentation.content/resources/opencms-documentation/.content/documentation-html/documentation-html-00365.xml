      <content><![CDATA[<p>Up to now, we hid a small but quite important detail. There is a second point in placing content type definitions in modules. An XSD makes up a content type definition, but not a type as you use it in OpenCms. The content type must be configured as resource and explorer type to become visible in OpenCms. For example, a content type is only visible in the "Add wizard" that is used to add new content, if it is configured as resource and explorer type.</p>
<p>The subtle distinction between content, resource and explorer type is necessary for mainly two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, not each content type definition should make up a new type that is exposed in OpenCms. Sometimes content type defintions are only used nested in other definitions.</li>
<li>Second, the raw type defintion lacks some extra information that is necessary or at least useful. E.g., the type has no icon, no nice-name, etc. Resource and explorer type configurations add those informations. At the moment it is not necessary to distinguish the two configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important information added by the type configurations are a unique type id and a unique name. These will be used by OpenCms to refer to a type.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">In most cases it is not necessary to distinguish between content, resource and explorer type. Thus, <em>we will simply say "<strong>type</strong>" and mean a content type that is configured as resource and explorer type</em>. The type's name, id, etc. refers always to the values configured in the resource or explorer type configuration.</div>]]></content>
