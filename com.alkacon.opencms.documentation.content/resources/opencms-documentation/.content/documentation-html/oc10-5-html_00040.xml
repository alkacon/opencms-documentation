      <content><![CDATA[<p>The main advantages of the single-tree approach are</p>
<ul>
<li>it is very easy to set up. You can use your existing uni-lingual page, change some configurations and start translating,</li>
<li>it is easy to maintain, since there are no duplicate folder structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ease of use and maintance is a big advantage, but it causes also some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>you publish always all language versions (since the contents rendered are necessarily the same in each locale variant of a page)</li>
<li>you have the same folder names in the URLs for each locale variant (which is bad in terms of SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summing up the pros and cons, the single-tree approach is probably <strong>very suitable for "Applications"</strong>. For example, customer portals, where you have a fixed functionality that should be accessible in various languages. In this scenario SEO is not important, since only customers get a login or an invitation or some other information to be directed to the page.</p>]]></content>
