      <content><![CDATA[<p>Before you go on, you have to decide which approach you want to take for adding locale variants of the tutorial website.</p>
<p>There are two approaches for adding the German and the French translation of the tutorial website. You can go either way.</p>
<p>The <strong>multi-tree approach</strong> is very flexible. It's basically as flexible as setting up completely independent websites for each locale. OpenCms provides a suitable UI to keep track of which pages are locale variants of each other and good support to add new locale variants of pages. But still, you have to keep track of a single folder tree for each locale variant of the website. So the approach is <em>basically suitable for all use cases</em>, but causes a bit more set up and maintenance effort than the single-tree approach.</p>
<p>The <strong>single-tree approach</strong> is very easy to set up and maintain. Basically, you have each page just once and render it for different locales. As a side-effect, you have (except of a locale prefix) the same URLs for the different locale variants, which might be a SEO problem. Moreover, you cannot have a diverging structure for the different locale variants of the site. The approach is <em>optimal for web applications</em>, e.g., customer portals, where the same functionality is provided in each language and SEO does not matter.</p>
<p>If you have decided on your approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="%(link0)">Go on here to take the multi-tree approach</a></li>
<li><a href="%(link1)">Go on here to take the single-tree approach</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-danger">If you want to try both approaches in parallel, you should use separate OpenCms installations. Importing the tutorial content twice in different sites will probably cause problems, because the ids of the imported contents already exist.</div>]]></content>
