      <content><![CDATA[<p>OpenCms allows for multiple image transformations. Here we list some of them and how to use them at the bean. Each method returns the modified bean again, now holding the information on the transformation. Hence, you can chain a whole sequence of these transformations. We call the attribute holding the image bean <code>ib</code>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">All scaling <strong>operations are performed based on the original image when finally the image link is requested</strong>. That means in particular hi dpi versions of a formerly down-scaled image are not the up-scaled versions of the down-scaled image, but also (in the best case) down-scaled versions of the original image. Hence there is <strong>no</strong> quality issue here.</div>]]></content>
