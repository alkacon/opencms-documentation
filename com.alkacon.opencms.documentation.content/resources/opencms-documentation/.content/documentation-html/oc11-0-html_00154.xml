      <content><![CDATA[<p>Depending on your requirements, it can be valuable to access OpenCms via a proxy, e.g., HaProxy, nginx, .... This might for example be the case when you have a cluster setup and need load balancing, you need to access various different backends depending on the URLs, ....</p>
<p>Installing OpenCms behind a proxy should work out of the box. But you might also want to serve resources that are statically exported by OpenCms directly from the proxy. To achive this, have a look at the<a href="%(link0)"> traditional installation with the Apache Webserver</a>. You need only the parts about the rewrite rules concerned with static export.</p>
<p>An advanced setup with docker could, for example, include a container for HaProxy, a container for OpenCms (connecting to an external database) and one for a Let's Encrypt certbot. HaProxy could do the encryption with the certificates provided by the certbot, could serve statically exported resources and manage the interplay of potentially more backends.</p>
<p>The best setup for you - and the components you might use - will depend on your concrete needs and there is no "best" solution we can provide here.&nbsp;</p>]]></content>
