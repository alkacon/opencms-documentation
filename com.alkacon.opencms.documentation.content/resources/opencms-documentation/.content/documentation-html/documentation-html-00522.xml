      <content><![CDATA[<p>When you set up a website with OpenCms you are already an OpenCms developer. You adjust OpenCms to the needs of your website, and add your own modules with templates and content types. But you may also dive deeper into the OpenCms internals. Here are three scenarios where you can work in as developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the simplest scenario, you only use the predefined functionality, add your own templates and content types (or adjust the demo template and content).</li>
<li>In a more challenging scenario, you add extra Java code to your modules that handle special functionality of your website. So you extend OpenCms with your own functionality.</li>
<li>The last scenario is, that you work at the "cutting edge". You contribute to the OpenCms core and get your functionality shipped with the next OpenCms version<span class="footnote">Of course, that assumes your functionality is selected for being added</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependent on your scenario, the development environment will differ. The next sections will give you an overview on recommended development environments.</p>]]></content>
