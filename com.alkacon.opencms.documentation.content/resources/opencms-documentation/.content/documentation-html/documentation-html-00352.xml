      <content><![CDATA[<p>Most of the settings that are available in the default configuration are also available via the preferences dialog of the traditional workplace. But the new dialog provides several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is configurable: Settings can be sorted and the tab in which they appear can be choosen</li>
<li>It is extendible: New settings can be added and will directly be shown in the dialog</li>
<li>It is easier to access for content editors: It is integrated in the ADE surface and it is unneccessary to open the traditional workplace .</li>
