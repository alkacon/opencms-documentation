      <content><![CDATA[<p>We started with a website available only in English. During the tutorial, we translated the page to German and French. We ended up with complete translations of the site. In general, it is not necessary to translate everything. Basically, the three locale variants of the site are completely independent. Only single pages are linked via the "locale variant" relation to keep track of what page is a translation of another. This independence results in great flexibilty. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>translate only part of the pages of your website</li>
<li>have different folder structures for differerent langugages</li>
<li>link pages with different content (elements) as locale variants of each other</li>
<li>have locally stored content copies for each of the locale variants (e.g., using "Copy elements" as copy mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it is possible to link pages from different sites via the "locale variant" relation<span class="footnote">The same main locale needs to be configured for the sites.</span>.</p>
<p>With the just described flexibilty, the multi-tree approach should be suitable for nearly every scenario. It works really well</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have your website in the main language already present and then start adding more locale variants,</li>
<li>if you add a new page in the main language and then add translations,</li>
<li>if you change existing content elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The restrictions of the approach are that</p>
<ul>
<li>pages can only be related via the main locale,</li>
<li>adding/deleting a content element in one locale variant of a page is not automatically reflected in the other locale variants.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second restriction can also be considered as a "plus". The first one typically should not cause problems.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the approach makes it suitable for all scenarios.</p>]]></content>
