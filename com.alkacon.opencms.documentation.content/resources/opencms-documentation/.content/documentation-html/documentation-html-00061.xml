      <content><![CDATA[<p>The content editor in OpenCms 8.5 has been completely rewritten in HTML 5 for ease-of-use and speed. The editor is automatically generated based on XML schemas describing the structure of content types. It provides a rich user interface for the content managers that are used to generate XML files based on the XML schemas. The generated XML is then stored in the OpenCms repository.</p>
<p><strong>Main features of the content editor are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Runs on the client side and provides a highly responsive user experience.</li>
<li>Automatically generated from an XML schema, no programming required.</li>
<li>Provides a large selection of rich user interface widgets.</li>
<li>Can be extended with custom user interface widgets for special use cases.</li>
<li>Generates XML files that are validated against the XML schema and stored in the database.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
